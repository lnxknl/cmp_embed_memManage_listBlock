### Dependencies

The dependencies for [Embedded Artistry's standardized Meson build system](https://embeddedartistry.com/fieldatlas/embedded-artistrys-standardized-meson-build-system/) are described [on our website](https://embeddedartistry.com/fieldatlas/embedded-artistrys-standardized-meson-build-system/).

In addition to those dependencies, you will need the following for this repository:

* [`git-lfs`](https://git-lfs.github.com) is used to store binary files

### Development Process

`master` contains the latest code for this project, and new versions are tagged nightly.

Please branch from `master` for any new changes. Once you are ready to merge changes, open a pull request. The build server will test and analyze the branch to ensure it can be safely merged.

### Building the Project

This project uses [Embedded Artistry's standardized Meson build system](https://embeddedartistry.com/fieldatlas/embedded-artistrys-standardized-meson-build-system/). Complete instructions can be found [on our website](https://embeddedartistry.com/fieldatlas/embedded-artistrys-standardized-meson-build-system/).

### Adding New Implementations

If you area adding new files to the library that will apply across RTOSes, you will need to modify [`src/meson.build`](../src/meson.build) and add the new file to the `common_files` list.

```
common_files = [
	'aligned_malloc.c',
	'posix_memalign.c'
]
```

If you would like to create a `malloc`/`free` implementation for a new RTOS:
	* Copy the `libmemory_threadx` library target and dependency
	* Rename the build target and library output to match the RTOS
	* Add the relevant RTOS headers to the `dependencies/rtos` folder
	* Update include paths if necessary
	* Add your `malloc_*rtos*.c` file to that RTOS's build list

### Adding New Tests

If you add code you need to add tests! Weâ€™ve learned the hard way that code without tests is undependable. If your pull request reduces our test coverage because it lacks tests then it will be rejected.

This project uses CMocka as the testing framework.

Please follow these guidelines:

* New tests should be added to the [`test/src/`](../test/src) directory tree
* Each function should have its own tests in its own C file.
* When adding a new test, add the following to the relevant test coordination file:
	* Add an `extern` function declaration in [main.c](../test/main.c): `extern int ctype_tests(void);`
	* Add a call to the test coordinator in [main.c](../test/main.c): `overall_result |= ctype_tests();`
